<li><b><u>Spiritual Significance :</u></b></li>
    Puri Beach holds immense spiritual significance due to its proximity to the famous Jagannath Temple, one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites in Hinduism. Pilgrims often take a dip in the sea at Puri Beach as a ritual cleansing before visiting the temple. The beach is also an integral part of the annual Rath Yatra (Chariot Festival), during which the deities from the Jagannath Temple are transported on grand chariots to the Gundicha Temple.
